Overview of the core behavioral tasks for LEVANTE. This repo contains details (and eventually, implementations) for each of these tasks, as well as the reasoning behind adaptations we make in order to shorten or adjust the difficulty to avoid ceiling/floor effects.

1. Matrix Reasoning [George]
	- Ravens CPM would be 40 Qs (~20 mins), short could be ~10 items?
	- 15-item short form SPM 9-12 and 13-16 have r=.89 and r=.93 https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjdp.12381 

2. Hearts & Flowers [EF: Inhibition] [George]
	- 3.5 is the youngest you can go
	- practice trials: 6 hearts, 6 flowers, 6 mixed (1500ms + 500 ISI)
	- test trials: 8 hearts, 12 flowers, 12 mixed (1500ms), 12 mixed (1250ms)
	- 6+6+6+8+12+12+12 = 62 trials * 2s/trial = 2min — can’t save a lot of time in the task!

3. Corsi Block [EF: WM] [George]
	- age-appropriate grid size could be set
	- for pre-k, they only do the forward block (backward is too hard)

4. Something’s the Same [EF: Cognitive Flexibility]
	- Michael Sulik?

5. MEFS [EF] - external 
	- Minnesota Executive Function Scale


6. Social Perception [SocialCog: Gaze Following] - external


7. ToM Battery [SocialCog: Theory of Mind] [Rebecca]
	- 2 booklets..so pick age-appropriate booklet? (Or subset of 1?)
	- food, snack, and dog content needs to be adapted

8. OxEd Language Screen [Language: Expressive] - external [$25/kid for pilot]


9. ROAR Vocab [Language: Vocab]  - external? [Bria]


10. ROAR Single Word Reading [Language: Single-word Reading] - external?


11. ROAR Sentence Comprehension [Language: Reading Comprehension] - external?


12. Number Line Estimation [Math: Approximate Math] (ask Daniel Ansari?)
	- how many problems? 5? 0-10, 0-100 (5+, only 0-100],  [0,1000] (9-12?)
	“The materials included a 15-cm line with one end marked with 0 and the other end marked with 100 (i.e., min = 0, max = 100) and 28 numbers: 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 14, 17, 18, 20, 21, 24, 25, 29, 33, 39, 42, 48, 50, 52, 57, 61, 64, 72, 79, 81, 84, 90, and 96. The number 20 and 50 were used for practice.”

13. EGMA [Math: Symbolic Math] [Rebecca]
	- all subtasks?
	- Number Identification (say the number) - (60 s; 20 items total) VERBAL
	- Number Discrimination (which is bigger?) - (2 practice, 10 items)
	- Missing number (sequence) - (2 practice, 10 items)
	- Addition (level 1) - (20 items, 60 s)
	- Addition (level 2) - (5 items)
	- Subtraction (level 1)
	- Subtraction (level 2)
	- word problems (nix due to overlap with language?)
	… - multiplication? (Add for oldest kids to eliminate ceiling?)

14. Mental Rotation Task [Visual-Spatial] [George/Rebecca]
	- ghost + other stimuli
	- can we show an animation (of rotating and matching), and frame as match-to-sample?

15. Child Survey Questions [Amy & Bobby]
